Rinkeby contract deployment of AUTRaffle.sol address: 0xcf1f697736ec8f723fb526e0c3aa4b654c1a6443

Interact with the contract at https://remix.ethereum.org/ by clicking on the "Run" tab in the top right, 
then under the "Deploy" button, copy the deployed address above into the box and click the "At Address" button.

The deployed instance will appear under "Deployed Contracts".  Click the arrow to see how to interact with it.

You will need Rinkeby test ether to pay the gas costs of interacting with the contract.  You can get free Rinkeby ether 
from https://faucet.rinkeby.io/.

Transactions are the pick buttons - after clicking one, you might need to click the Metamask extension
to bring up the transaction window.

Only the owner of the contract can open raffles and pick winners but if a raffle is open, 
anyone other than the owner can enter it.  Feel free to enter - I will plan to leave it open for several days beginning
8/28/18 before picking a winner.
